# run_tests.sh -- one-step test runner for the VB.NET binding.
# Builds libitb3.so + the solution via build.sh, points
# ITB_LIBITB3_PATH at the freshly-built shared library, then invokes
# `dotnet test -c Release`. Positional arguments are forwarded
# through to dotnet test (e.g. `--filter` to scope the run).
#
# build.sh wipes the bin/ and obj/ tree of every project in the
# solution -- the C# library member included -- before it builds, so
# the assemblies exercised here are always the ones this invocation
# produced, which is what makes the --no-build below safe. Set
# ITB_SKIP_CLEAN=1 to keep the existing artefacts and build
# incrementally instead.
#
# Usage:
#   ./run_tests.sh                              # all tests
#   ./run_tests.sh --filter FullyQualifiedName~Smoke
#   ./run_tests.sh --logger 'console;verbosity=detailed'
