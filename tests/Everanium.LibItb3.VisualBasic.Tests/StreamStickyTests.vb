' A decrypt session fed a tampered wire fails with a sticky MAC
' failure. Uses a position probe rather than a single bit flip
' because the over-sized container carries CSPRNG residue in the
' non-payload area — a flip that lands inside the residue is
' architecturally inert (residue is not payload) and the session
' finishes clean. Probing 32 evenly-spaced positions makes the
' all-residue probability negligible; the first position that
' surfaces an error must give Status.MacFailure and remain sticky on
' subsequent reads.
