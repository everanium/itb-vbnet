## ITB VB.NET Binding

> **Security notice.** ITB is an experimental symmetric cipher construction without prior peer review, independent cryptanalysis, or formal certification. The construction's security properties have **not been verified** by independent cryptographers or mathematicians.
>
> PRF-grade hash functions are **required**. No warranty is provided.

**No bespoke cryptography.** ITB introduces no cryptographic primitive of its own — no custom S-box, permutation, or round function. It is a construction over existing primitives, much as PGP composes standard ciphers rather than defining one. Such constructions are not the object of algorithm-level cryptographic certification: national regimes (NIST CAVP/FIPS in the US, GOST/FSB in Russia, OSCCA's SM-series in China, IC3S in India, SOG-IS/EUCC and national lists in the EU, ASD's ISM in Australia, CRYPTREC in Japan, KCMVP in South Korea) certify **primitives** and the **modules** built on them, not compositional schemes. Eligibility for regulated use is therefore inherited from the primitives ITB is configured with, not conferred by ITB itself.

Thin proxy over the sibling [C# binding](https://github.com/everanium/itb/tree/main/bindings/csharp/) — plain CLR
bytecode interop against the `Everanium.LibItb3.dll` assembly, no FFI layer of its
own. The C# binding carries the source-generated P/Invoke surface,
the libitb3 lookup order, the SafeHandle lifetime (finalizer
backstop), and the buffer pre-allocation with the BufferTooSmall
retry-once; this layer re-shapes that surface into idiomatic VB.NET:
`Using` blocks over `IDisposable` types, structured
`Try ... Catch ex As ItbException` error handling with the binding's
own `Status` enum, `Byte()` signatures throughout, and chaining
`Opts` setters. Every hash-name / MAC-name / cipher-name /
profile-name remains an opaque string passed through to Go for
validation; no ITB construction logic lives on the .NET side.

The public surface is one `Pipeline` type (Init / Load / Save / Rekey /
Close, Single Message encrypt / decrypt, one-shot and incremental
stream sessions with `System.IO.Stream` pumps), an `Opts` builder,
the C# layer's `Everanium.Itb3.Profile` record with the registry entries
`Pipeline.Register` / `Lookup` / `Profiles` and the blob reader
`Pipeline.Inspect`, and the Go runtime knobs on `Library`.
Stream sessions pin their parent `Pipeline` (the `Parent` property),
so a pipeline stays reachable while a session on it is live;
unreachable un-disposed handles are reclaimed by the C# layer's
SafeHandle finalizer.

## Prerequisites (Arch Linux)

```bash
sudo pacman -S go dotnet-sdk
```

Generic Linux / macOS: a Go toolchain plus the .NET SDK (net10.0
target framework; Visual Basic ships with the SDK). Windows: the
same; libitb3 builds as `libitb3.dll`.

## Build

The convenience driver builds `libitb3.so` plus the solution (the
ProjectReference chain pulls the sibling C# binding library in
automatically):

```bash
./bindings/vbnet/build.sh
```

Equivalent manual invocation:

```bash
go build -trimpath -buildmode=c-shared \
    -o dist/linux-amd64/libitb3.so ./cmd/cshared
cd bindings/vbnet && dotnet build Everanium.LibItb3.VisualBasic.sln -c Release
```

## Library lookup order

Native resolution happens entirely in the C# layer:

1. `ITB_LIBITB3_PATH` environment variable (path to the shared
   library file).
2. `<repo>/dist/<os>-<arch>/libitb3.<ext>` located by walking up from
   the assembly directory (in-repo builds).
3. The OS default loader path (`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `ld.so.cache`,
   `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `PATH`).

## Usage example

```vb
Imports Everanium.Itb3.VisualBasic
Imports Profile = Everanium.Itb3.Profile

Using sender As Pipeline = Pipeline.Init("singlemsg-triple-mac-v1")
    Using receiver As Pipeline = Pipeline.Load(sender.Save())
        Dim wire As Byte() = sender.EncryptMessage(
            Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("any text or binary data"))
        Dim plain As Byte() = receiver.DecryptMessage(wire)
    End Using
End Using
' Or persist the session to disk and reopen it later:
'   sender.SaveF("/path/session.blob")
'   Using receiver As Pipeline = Pipeline.LoadF("/path/session.blob")
'   End Using
```

The `Opts` builder overrides the profile default at `Init` (chunk
size, outer cipher, parallax on/off, wrapper on/off, MAC name,
palette, `MaxWorkers`); the blob the receiver loads carries the
resolved shape, so `Load` takes no opts:

```vb
Dim opts As Opts = New Opts().WithChunkSize(65536).WithWrapper(False)
Using sender As Pipeline = Pipeline.Init("singlemsg-triple-mac-v1", opts)
    Using receiver As Pipeline = Pipeline.Load(sender.Save())
        ' ...
    End Using
End Using
```

`Pipeline.Rekey` rotates the parallax + wrapper masters mid-session
(the eight ITB seeds and MAC key are fixed for the session lifetime
by design) and returns the refreshed blob; the receiver picks up
the new masters through a fresh `Save()` / `Load` handshake:

```vb
Dim perm(31) As Byte : Array.Fill(perm, CByte(&H11))
Dim wrap(31) As Byte : Array.Fill(wrap, CByte(&H22))
Dim rotated As Byte() = sender.Rekey(perm, wrap)
Using receiver As Pipeline = Pipeline.Load(rotated)
End Using
```

For bounded-memory streaming, `EncryptStreamPump` /
`DecryptStreamPump` move any `System.IO.Stream` source into any
`System.IO.Stream` sink through an incremental session; the explicit
`BeginEncryptStream` / `BeginDecryptStream` sessions expose `Write`
/ `End` / `Read` for caller-driven loops.

Profile names, opts keys, and every primitive name are validated by
the Go side; a rejected string surfaces as `ItbException` carrying
the `Status` code plus the `ITB_LastError` diagnostic:

```vb
Try
    Using pipe As Pipeline = Pipeline.Init("no-such-profile")
    End Using
Catch ex As ItbException
    Console.Error.WriteLine($"{ex.Status}: {ex.Message}")
End Try
```

## Persisting sessions

The blob `Save()` returns is self-describing: it carries the profile
record (the resolved pipeline shape) alongside the key material, so
a receiver reconstructs the session from the blob alone.

```vb
Dim blob As Byte() = sender.Save()                  ' current session blob
sender.SaveF("/path/session.blob")                  ' same bytes, written by the library (mode 0600)
Dim a As Pipeline = Pipeline.Load(blob)             ' reopen from bytes
Dim b As Pipeline = Pipeline.LoadF("/path/session.blob") ' reopen from a file
Dim c As Pipeline = Pipeline.Load(blob, perm, wrap) ' reopen with a master override
Dim p As Profile = Pipeline.Inspect(blob)       ' metadata only, no Pipeline opened
```

Load works for blobs generated with shipped primitives (every entry
in the shipped catalogue). Blobs generated by Go programs that use
`hashes.Register` or `macs.Register` to install custom primitives
cannot be loaded through this binding — the receiver must use the Go
library directly and register the same custom primitive under the
same name before opening. Attempting to load such a blob through
this binding surfaces `Status.RecipePrimitiveUnknown`. A blob from an earlier wrap-layer
version surfaces `Status.BadInput`; a record that fails the profile field
rules surfaces `Status.BlobMalformedRecipe`.

The profile registry is reachable through the same `Everanium.Itb3.Profile`
record:

```vb
Dim names As String() = Pipeline.Profiles()         ' sorted registry names
Dim shipped As Profile = Pipeline.Lookup("singlemsg-triple-nomac-v1")
Dim custom As New Profile With {
    .Mode = "singlemsg-nomac", .Width = 512, .Hash = "areion512", .KeyBits = 1024,
    .Wrapper = False, .Parallax = False}
Pipeline.Register("my-profile", custom)            ' validated by Go; duplicate -> ProfileExists
```

`Everanium.Itb3.Profile` is a plain record plus JSON codec — no validation happens
on the binding side. `Inspect` / `Lookup` return it; `Register`
accepts it; an unknown name at `Init` / `Lookup` surfaces `Status.UnknownProfile`.

Runtime tuning: `pipeline.MaxWorkers(n)` sets the worker cap for every
subsequent cipher call (`n <= 0` selects auto, `n > 256` is clamped
to 256); the receiver may pick its own worker cap after `Load` — the
cap is per-machine and never written to the blob.

## Memory

Two process-wide knobs constrain Go runtime arena pacing, readable
at libitb3 load time via env vars (`ITB_GOMEMLIMIT`, `ITB_GOGC`) and
adjustable at any time programmatically. Pass `-1` to query without
changing:

```vb
Library.SetMemoryLimit(4L * 1024 * 1024 * 1024)
Library.SetGCPercent(100)
```

## Testing

```bash
./bindings/vbnet/run_tests.sh
```

The harness builds `libitb3.so`, exports `ITB_LIBITB3_PATH`, and
invokes `dotnet test -c Release`. Positional arguments are forwarded
to dotnet test (e.g. `./run_tests.sh --filter
FullyQualifiedName~Smoke`). The suite covers Single Message round
trips per shipped profile, stream pumps, incremental sessions with
pathological batch sizes, tampered-wire failure stickiness,
mid-flight cancellation, rekey, session persistence (save / load, saveF / loadF, inspect, lookup / profiles / register, maxWorkers), error mapping,
and Opts query rendering — surface parity checks; the deep suite
lives in Go under the shipped tree.

## Benchmarking

```bash
./bindings/vbnet/run_bench.sh            # both shapes
./bindings/vbnet/run_bench.sh message    # Single Message shape only
./bindings/vbnet/run_bench.sh stream     # stream-pump shape only
```

`Stopwatch`-timed micro-benches: `EncryptMessage` and stream-pump
throughput at 1 MiB / 16 MiB / 64 MiB. Shape and budget are driven
by the `ITB_*` env vars listed in
`bench/Everanium.LibItb3.VisualBasic.Bench/BenchUtil.vb`; defaults match
the root Go BENCH3.md pin.

## itb3 CLI

The Go core ships an openssl-style CLI utility
[`itb3`](https://github.com/everanium/itb/tree/main/cmd/itb3/) that generates session blobs on disk
(`itb3 genblob <mode> <hash> -o blob.json`); this binding reopens
such blobs via `Pipeline.LoadF`. `itb3` also encrypts / decrypts
payloads directly on disk (`-i` / `-o`) or through stdin / stdout,
rotates outer masters, and inspects stored blobs. See
[`cmd/itb3/README.md`](https://github.com/everanium/itb/blob/main/cmd/itb3/README.md) for the full
subcommand reference.

## eitb utility

The `Everanium.LibItb3.VisualBasic.Eitb` console project mirrors the
shipped Go `tools/eitb` scope for shell smoke tests:

```bash
cd bindings/vbnet
dotnet run -c Release --project eitb/Everanium.LibItb3.VisualBasic.Eitb -- version
dotnet run -c Release --project eitb/Everanium.LibItb3.VisualBasic.Eitb -- profiles
dotnet run -c Release --project eitb/Everanium.LibItb3.VisualBasic.Eitb -- encrypt singlemsg-triple-mac-v1 in.bin out.bin  # blob hex on stderr
dotnet run -c Release --project eitb/Everanium.LibItb3.VisualBasic.Eitb -- decrypt singlemsg-triple-mac-v1 <blob-hex> out.bin back.bin
```

## Limitations

- The binding wraps the Triple Pipeline surface only. The Low-Level
  seed / MAC / blob / wrapper / parallax APIs are not exposed — use
  the shipped Go core for those.
- Streaming-decrypt caveat: chunked Streaming AEAD verifies per
  chunk, so plaintext of verified chunks is released before a later
  chunk can fail authentication.
- `ITB_LastError` is process-global last-write-wins; the textual
  diagnostic attached to an `ItbException` may belong to a different
  call under concurrent FFI use. The status code is always
  attributable.
- `Rekey` must not run concurrently with cipher calls or open stream
  sessions on the same `Pipeline`.
- `Pipeline.Save()` returns a fresh `Byte()` on each call (the C#
  layer reads the blob from libitb3 on every call).
- The sibling C# binding source (`bindings/csharp/Itb`) must be
  present — the solution builds it via ProjectReference — and libitb3
  must be reachable at runtime through the lookup order above.
