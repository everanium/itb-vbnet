' Incremental stream sessions over an open Pipeline.
'
' A session is a dumb byte pump: EncryptStream takes plaintext in
' through Write and yields wire through Read / CopyTo; DecryptStream
' is the mirror (wire in, plaintext out). All chunking, MAC,
' envelope, and wire-format decisions stay inside libitb3. Disposing
' a session cancels it and frees the Go-side state; the session
' keeps a reference to the parent Pipeline (both the VB wrapper and,
' inside the C# layer, the wrapped C# Pipeline), so the pipeline
' stays reachable while a session on it is live.
