' Delegating lifetime wrapper around the C# layer's Pipeline.
'
' Every member forwards to the sibling C# binding (bindings/csharp)
' through plain CLR bytecode interop — no FFI layer of its own. The
' C# side carries the P/Invoke surface, the handle lifetime
' (SafeHandle finalizer backstop), the buffer pre-allocation with
' the BufferTooSmall retry-once, and the libitb3 lookup order; this
' layer re-shapes that surface into idiomatic VB.NET (Using blocks,
' Try ... Catch ex As ItbException, Byte() signatures).

''' <summary>
''' A Triple Pipeline session.
'''
''' <see cref="Save"/> exports the self-describing session blob the
''' receiver feeds to <see cref="Load"/> / <see cref="LoadF"/>;
''' <see cref="Rekey"/> refreshes it. Disposing the Pipeline frees
''' the handle (libitb3 zeroes key material internally); an
''' undisposed Pipeline is reclaimed by the C# layer's SafeHandle
''' finalizer. Profile records (<see cref="Inspect"/> /
''' <see cref="Lookup"/> results, <see cref="Register"/> input) are
''' the C# layer's <see cref="Global.Everanium.Itb3.Profile"/> type.
'''
''' Streaming-decrypt caveat: chunked Streaming AEAD verifies per
''' chunk, so plaintext of verified chunks is released before a later
''' chunk can fail authentication.
