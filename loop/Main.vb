' Long-run stress harness. The loop utility holds one Pipeline handle
' per exercised cipher surface for minutes, hammers it with concurrent
' encrypt → decrypt → compare round-trips from N worker threads, rotates
' the outer masters and reopens the handle from its session blob on a
' schedule, and reports whether the process survived with every byte
' intact. It is the VB.NET binding's counterpart of the Go harness under
' tools/loop: the same flags, the same round structure, the same summary
' in both renderings.
'
' The default shape is full production: the Streaming AEAD profile with
' parallax on, wrapper on, hmac-blake3 MAC, Areion-SoEM-512 inner hash,
' 1024-bit keys, and the compile-in 512-bit nonce width, driven through a
' stream session by three workers for five minutes on 16 MiB plaintexts.
' Every worker owns a distinct CSPRNG-generated plaintext held for the
' whole run, so any cross-call state leakage inside the Pipeline surfaces
' as a data mismatch between workers rather than cancelling out.
'
' A failure is one of two things. A cipher, rekey or load call that
' returns a non-OK status is a worker error: the run stops, the summary
' lists it, the verdict is FAIL and the exit code 1. A round-trip that
' returns without error but with different bytes is a data mismatch: the
' process terminates on the spot with exit code 3, printing the worker,
' the iteration and the first differing offset, and no summary — the
' state that produced the wrong bytes is the evidence. A crash inside the
' shared library or the host runtime has no exit code of its own here;
' surfacing it is what the utility is for. This binding runs a Go
' c-shared runtime and CoreCLR in one process, two runtimes that each
' drive threads through signals, which is the interaction the long run is
' meant to expose.
'
' Usage:
'
'   ./bin/Release/net10.0/Everanium.LibItb3.VisualBasic.Loop --duration 5m \
'          --goroutines 3 --shape stream --hash areion512 \
'          --mac hmac-blake3 --payload-size 16MB --memlimit auto \
'          --parallax on --wrapper on
'
' Ctrl-C triggers a graceful shutdown: in-flight iterations complete,
' then the partial summary prints.
